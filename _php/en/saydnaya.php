                    <p>Saydnaya Military Prison is located 30km north of Damascus, Syria. The prison is under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Defence and operated by the Military Police. Saydnaya became notorious for the use of torture and excessive force following a riot by detainees in 2008. There are two buildings on the Saydnaya site, which between them could contain 10,000-20,000 prisoners.</p>

                    <p>Since the beginning of the crisis in Syria in 2011, the prison has become the final destination for both peaceful opponents of the authorities as well as military personnel suspected of opposing the regime.</p>

                    <p>Detainees are generally transferred to this facility after spending months or even years in detention elsewhere. Such transfers often take place following a flagrantly unfair trial at a secret military court. Others arrive at the prison without having seen a judge and do not know the alleged charges against them or how long they will be detained.</p>

                    <p>Amnesty International spoke to survivors of Saydnaya, who all reported systematic daily beatings, sub-human conditions, degrading treatment, as well as other prisoners dying on a daily basis. Many were denied food and water for prolonged periods. Guards ruthlessly enforced a rule of absolute silence.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <div class="text">I felt we had entered a slaughterhouse</div>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>There are no interrogations at Saydnaya. Torture isn’t used to obtain information, but seemingly as a way to degrade, punish and humiliate. Prisoners are targeted relentlessly, unable to “confess” to save themselves from further beatings. Survivors say they dreaded family visits as they were always followed by extensive beatings.</p>

                    <p>Prisoners do not have access to a lawyer. In several cases, relatives were told by the government that the prisoner had died, when in fact they were still being held at Saydnaya.</p>
